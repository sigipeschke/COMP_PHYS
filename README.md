Course work in computational physics was done over two courses, completed by myself with some group work and includes:

PHYS 381:

Analyzing how floating point approximation effects mathematical concepts such as finding the zero points of a function. 

Analysis of polynomial series such as Taylor series expansion for various functions, Legendre polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials and Lissajous curves. 

Analysis of Chebyshev polynomials, which are solutions to the Chebyshev differential equations, using the weighted integral to confirm orthogonality. Analysis of Lissajous curves, determining properties of an object moving along a Lissajous curve, confirming that a specific Lissajous curve is a Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind. 

Using polynomials, annual and semi-annual harmonics to fit trend-lines to data, then using such a fit to make predictions based on data. Specific example is data of the mole fraction of CO2 in the air at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii since 1958 and using this to predict CO2 in the year 2100. 

Integrating functions using various libraries as well as developing your own methods for finding the area under a curve. 

Analysis of ordinary differential equations, specifically a driven and damped harmonic oscillator. 

Analysis of the Mandelbrot set which includes finding divergent stable, periodic and chaotic points, and generating fractal images for various generalized Mandelbrot sets. Integer factorization, finding greatest common denominator between two numbers, and concepts with regards to modular exponentiation. 


PHYS 481:

Macrostate probabilities, entropy and Gaussian fit analysis of coin tosses and dice rolls. Lossless image compression and Huffman coding. 
Analysis of pseudo random number generators, using hyperplanes to determine uniformity, using bitstring analysis to possibly find non-randomness.

Analysis of Cellular Automaton, even sampling over various bit sizes and how this relates to entropy. 

Simulating random walks in order to model ideal gases, then determining statistics such as mean hitting time.


PHYS 581:

Principal Component Analysis and Singular Spectrum Analysis.

Strong focus on TensorFlow neural networks.

Error Function and Faddeeva function.
